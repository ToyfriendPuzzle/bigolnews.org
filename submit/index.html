			<b>DUE DATE:</b> Issues release the first Sunday of each month, submissions for that issue are due the Friday before (subject to change if we get too many submissions but that's likely never gonna be a problem).
			<br/>
			<b>MEDIUM:</b> Black and White art of all kinds! Text, comics, photos, puzzles, sheet music, whatever the heck can be printed onto a page.
			<br/>
			<b>TONE:</b> True and Objective Reporting. High Quality Journalism. Breaking News. The Masses Must See This. et cetera. We want your content to "plausibly" pass as "news" but we're not gonna be too picky.
			<br/>
			<b>VERISIMILITUDE:</b> "The appearance or semblance of truth", no matter how shallow. Resembling what truth? Whose truth? Your truth? A false truth? An invented truth? Lies, unreality, fiction and unfiction are all allowed- no- encouraged!
			<br/>
			<b>CATEGORIES:</b> Style, Obituaries, Upcoming Events, Nature/Pets, Local Arts, Puzzles and Games, Journalism, Interviews, Current Events, Editorials, Comics, Sports, Hobby/Skill, Ads, "Ads", Classifieds, "Op-eds", etc.
			<br/>
			<b>THE EDITORS:</b> can dress your submission up with News Buzzwords Wow! or blurbs or whatever to make it fit into the newspaper better if what you submitted on its own doesn't have that news je ne sais quoi.
			<br/>
			<b>DENIALS:</b> We can and will deny submissions that do not fit the above or that we simply do not like. So long as you're submitting in good faith we will try to work with you about it.
			<br/>
			<b>WHERE/HOW:</b> <a href="mailto: bigolnews@pm.me">bigolnews@pm.me</a> is the email address for submissions. Include how you would like to be credited (or credited anonymously, or not credited at all), the category you're submitting to, and whether you want your submission physical-only or not. If you leave out any of that info, it's up to The Editors to determine it for you.
