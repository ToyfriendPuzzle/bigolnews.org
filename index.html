                    An up and coming crop farmer, Alien Jones suffered major losses this week. An angry mob burned their entire harvest. The townspeople say that Jones was trying to "phone the mothership" with the goal of "abducting and probing" all human life. BON:er reached out to the farmer for comment. Alien Jones says that the townsfolk saw his crop circles, which were a message to his wife and child. "I wanted to update my wife about human celebrity gossip and the human woman fashion trends she loves so much." He may be from out of this world, but he is deserving of a life on it just like anyone else in his community. A GalaxyFundMe has been opened for the Jones family and they are optimistic and hopeful for the future.
