                <h1>Sign up & use the app to start learning</h1>
                <p style="margin:0;padding:0;"><a href="./archive/issue8">Issue 8, January 8, 2026</a></p>
                <p>An innocuous phrase, you’ve seen some variation on it a million times. But if you look closer you can see how absolutely precisely crafted and devilish it is.</p>
                <p>Sign up - Notice, this isn’t a command. It’s not actually addressed to anyone at all.</p>
                <p>& use the app - Use is a very, very vague verb. What does it mean to “use” an “app”? Fuckin’ beats me. Guess you gotta install it to find out. And what’s with the & and not “and”? Also beats me. Looks more “relatable”?</p>
                <p>to start earning - earning. earning. earn. To receive a reward for some achievement? To be paid for labor? There’s an implication that you will be required to do or give something before you can receive anything. And hang on, it says to start earning. So the previous clause “sign up & use the app” will not alone be enough to earn. That is just the prerequisite to start earning.</p>
                <p>Sign up & use the app to start earning - I would like to point out that there’s not even a period. It’s a fragment of a sentence.</p>
                <p>The whole thing reads like some command that you should perform to receive something, but if you actually pick it apart, it is a sort of vague statement of fact. A series of steps in some process that exists divorced from any actor or action.</p>
                <p>When “sign up & use the app” is completed, then the state of “earning” is unlocked.</p>
                <p>There’s no direct call to action, no promise of anything at all. An utterly empty sentence. And yet it might just trick you into installing an app and giving over a bunch of personal data and permissions to be spammed with ads in the future for that nothing.</p>
