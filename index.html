                <h1>Lincoln and Grimsby Schoolchildren Found Consuming Human Bones - Autopsy Impossible </h1>
                <p>
                    After reports of several missing local pets near schools in Lincoln and Grimsby, officials finally decided to check the school grounds—and they were shocked by what they found. 46 partial skeletons were found scattered across multiple elementary and middle school campuses, 12 of which were identifiably human. Of the remains found, only one still had some meat on its bones. Most of these remains were charred and riddled with gnaw marks, and many of the bones had been cracked open so the marrow could be sucked out. One police officer vomited on finding what has been termed “the cadaver stacks.”

                <p>
                    85 local children have been implicated in the murder and consumption of the as-of-yet unidentified remains. Police are dumbfounded as to how to move forward, given the huge number of suspects and the lack of anyone who truly gives a toot about any of the potential victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Maybe we just chalk this up to kids being kids?” one officer suggested at the press conference this morning. Police are currently declining to press charges.
